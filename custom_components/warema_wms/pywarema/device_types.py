"""
WMS device types and platform routing.

Single source of truth for the device-type table and for the mapping from a
device type to the Home Assistant platform that represents it.  Lives in
``pywarema`` (not in ``const.py``) so the protocol package stays importable on
its own; ``const.py`` re-exports the names for the HA-side modules.

Device types are the 2-char uppercase hex strings carried in the scan response
(``7021``) and in ``DEVICE_TYPE_STRINGS`` below.

Actuator classes:
  - Covers   : plug receivers, in-wall actuators and radio motors that drive
               blinds, shutters, awnings and slat roofs.
  - Dimmers  : stand-alone dimming actuators.  These are separate devices with
               their own serial number - a light is never a sub-channel of a
               motor - and they answer the same broadcast scan as any motor.
